## Objectives

1. **Data Analysis:**
   - Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover trends and insights from the clinical trial data.
   - Visualize key findings to communicate results effectively.

2. **Game Recommender System:**
   - Develop a collaborative filtering-based recommender system to suggest games to users.
   - Evaluate the performance of the recommender system and refine the model based on user feedback.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- PySpark
- Pandas
- NumPy
